##  Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
After W. Avy liked my analysis, he wanted more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. He particularly asked for temperature data for June and December in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Average temperature for June of 75 higher than that of December.
A total of 1700 temperatures was recorded in June as compared to 1517 recorded in December.
The December temperature is spread out as compared to June.

## Summary:
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
The data states that a high-level summary of the result that SD is 3.25 in June and 3.75 in December making a 0.5 difference between both seasons.
The data could break down the monthly data further into increments like days or weeks to get a good sense of how weather could shift as  the month progress
Since other factors affect surf, I would run this same analysis replacing temperature observations with wind speeds, or even incidents of winter storms within a certain mile radius, both of which would impact the types of waves that may provide favorable surfing conditions.
